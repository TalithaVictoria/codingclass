          I am a student at City arts and technologgy high school. </p>
        <p>  My interest are most things science realated, anime, drawing, swimming and the functions of the human body.I sometimes draw about my other interests which is pretty cool to me. I also love going to concerts and meeting famous people it is a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>
            My goals for college are to go to UCLA and get a major in science and a minor in math.I want to study abroad in Japan. I mean why not there's a lot of things about Japan that I admire. I also want to just learn all the things i can while I'm in college so that i may use those skills in gthe real world.
